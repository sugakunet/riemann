# Comprehensive Survey: Singularities of Analytic Continuations in Complex Analysis

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive survey presents the current state of research on singularities of analytic continuations in complex analysis, covering classical theorems, modern developments, and applications. The research encompasses eight major areas: Borel summation and singularities, gap theorems (Hadamard and Fabry), natural boundaries and barrier theorems, edge-of-the-wedge theorem, Phragmén-Lindelöf principles, Dirichlet series singularities, coefficient-singularity relationships, and recent computational advances.

## I. Classical Foundation Papers

### A. Hadamard and Mandelbrojt's Foundational Work
- **Jacques Hadamard (1892)**: "Essai sur l'étude des fonctions données par leur développement de Taylor" - established fundamental connections between power series coefficients and singularity locations
- **Hadamard & Mandelbrojt (1926)**: "La série de Taylor et son prolongement analytique" - comprehensive treatment of Taylor series and analytic continuation
- **Szolem Mandelbrojt (1927)**: "Modern researches on the singularities of functions defined by Taylor's series"

### B. George Pólya's Contributions
- **Pólya (1918)**: "Über die Potenzreihen, deren Konvergenzkreis natürliche Grenze ist" - power series with natural boundary circles
- **Pólya Collected Papers Volume 1**: Comprehensive treatment of singular points of analytic functions, focusing on deducing function properties from coefficient properties

## II. Gap Theorems and Natural Boundaries

### A. Hadamard Gap Theorem (Ostrowski-Hadamard)
**Statement**: If a power series has gaps satisfying Hadamard's condition (exponential growth λₖ₊₁ ≥ λₖ(1 + δ) for δ > 0), then the boundary of the disc of convergence is a natural boundary.

**Key Result**: Series like Σz^(2^n) have the unit circle as a natural boundary because all points Re^(iθ) must be singular.

### B. Fabry Gap Theorem
**Enhanced Result**: More powerful than Hadamard's theorem, requiring only that pₙ/n → ∞ (weaker condition than exponential growth).

**Modern Development**: 
- **arXiv:1105.1624 (2011)** - Schlage-Puchta: Combined Turán's proof with Szüsz's theorem to obtain more general gap theorem
- **arXiv:0710.5894 (2008)** - Eremenko: Version for power series with regularly varying coefficients, relating sign changes to analytic continuation

### C. Natural Boundaries and Spectral Theory
**arXiv:1002.0823 (2010)** - Breuer & Simon: Established analogy between lack of absolutely continuous spectrum for Schrödinger operators and natural boundaries for power series. Generalized Hecke's example for random power series without independence assumptions.

## III. Borel Summation and Singularities

### A. Classical Borel Transform Theory
The Borel transform encodes essential information about original series via singularity structure. When singularities cross integration contours in Laplace transform, Stokes phenomenon occurs with exponentially small corrections.

- Recent work on resurgent resummation from truncated series

## IV. Edge-of-the-Wedge Theorem and Extensions
