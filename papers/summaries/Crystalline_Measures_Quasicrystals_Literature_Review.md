# Crystalline Measures and Quasicrystals: Comprehensive Literature Review

## Overview

This document presents a comprehensive review of recent mathematical research on crystalline measures, Fourier quasicrystals, and related topics in aperiodic order. The search covered ArXiv papers from 2018-2025 focusing on key mathematical concepts that bridge harmonic analysis, number theory, and mathematical physics.

## Key Mathematical Concepts

### Definitions

**Crystalline Measures**: One-dimensional, tempered measures where both their support and the support of their Fourier transform are sparse (also called "doubly-sparse measures"). They include Fourier quasicrystals as a special case.

**Fourier Quasicrystals**: Discrete tempered Radon measures whose Fourier transform is also a discrete Radon measure. These represent the most structured type of crystalline measures.

**Meyer Sets**: Delone sets X such that X-X is a Delone set. Originally introduced by Yves Meyer in the 1970s for harmonic analysis, they became central to quasicrystal theory.

**Model Sets**: Point sets generated by the cut-and-project method from higher-dimensional lattices. They provide mathematical models for quasicrystalline structures.

**Cut-and-Project Schemes**: A method for constructing aperiodic point sets by projecting from higher-dimensional periodic structures.

The field of crystalline measures and mathematical quasicrystals has seen remarkable progress in recent years, with several fundamental questions resolved and new connections discovered. The work bridges multiple areas of mathematics including:

- Harmonic analysis (Fourier transforms, tempered distributions)
- Number theory (modular forms, L-functions, explicit formulas)
- Dynamical systems (aperiodic order, symbolic dynamics)
- Algebraic geometry (Lee-Yang varieties, real algebraic sets)
- Mathematical physics (diffraction theory, quantum mechanics)

The recent distinction between crystalline measures and Fourier quasicrystals (Favorov, 2024) represents a major conceptual advance, while the complete classification of crystalline measures with quadratic decay (Gonçalves, 2024) provides powerful new tools for the field.

Future work is likely to focus on:
