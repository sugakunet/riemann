## 1. Fundamental Differences: Dispersive vs Diffusive PDEs

### 1.1 Diffusive PDEs (Heat Equation Prototype)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Energy Dissipation**: For the heat equation ∂ₜu = Δu, testing with u itself yields d/dt ||u||²_{L²} = -||∇u||²_{L²}
- **Immediate Smoothing**: Singularities are instantly smoothed out
- **Infinite Speed of Propagation**: Information spreads instantaneously
- **Irreversibility**: Due to energy loss, processes cannot be reversed
- **Mathematical Structure**: Even-order spatial derivatives typically produce diffusive behavior

### 1.2 Dispersive PDEs (Schrödinger Equation Prototype)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Energy Conservation**: For iψₜ = ψₓₓ + Vψ, coefficient matrices have purely imaginary eigenvalues
- **Singularity Preservation**: Sharp features maintain their essential character while spreading
- **Wave Packet Spreading**: Different frequency components travel at different phase velocities
- **Reversibility**: Time-reversible due to energy conservation
- **Mathematical Structure**: Odd-order spatial derivatives typically produce dispersive behavior

### 1.3 Dispersion Relations and Energy Analysis

**Mathematical Characterization:**
- If ω(k) is real: energy conserved, each mode translates (odd spatial derivatives)
- If ω(k) has negative imaginary part: energy decays (even spatial derivatives, like heat equation)

## 2. Complex Space-Time Analysis

### 2.1 Wick Rotation and Complex Time

**Fundamental Connection:**
- Schrödinger equation ↔ Heat equation via t → it (Wick rotation)
- Heat equation with complex time parameter extends to holomorphic semigroup
- Boundary values on imaginary axis yield unitary Schrödinger evolution

**Mathematical Framework:**
- Heat semigroup e^{tΔ} extends holomorphically to {z ∈ ℂ : Re z > 0}
- Boundary values lim_{z→is} e^{zΔ} = e^{isΔ} (Schrödinger evolution)
- Feynman-Kac formula provides probabilistic interpretation

### 2.2 Complex Coefficients and Analytic Continuation
