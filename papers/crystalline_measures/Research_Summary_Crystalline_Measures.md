# Comprehensive Research Summary: Crystalline Measures and Fourier Quasicrystals with Non-Linear Support

## Overview

This document summarizes extensive research conducted on crystalline measures and Fourier quasicrystals, particularly focusing on non-linear support structures, polynomial density growth, and non-uniform discrete measures. The research covers recent developments from 2020-2025 and includes key theoretical contributions, computational techniques, and connections to various mathematical areas.

## 1. Crystalline Measures with Non-Linear Support

### 1.1 Support on Sets {n^(1/d)} or {n^α} with Fractional α

Recent research has shown significant progress in understanding crystalline measures with support on sets like {n^(1/d)} where the support points grow polynomially rather than linearly:

- **Growth of Masses of Crystalline Measures (2025)**: Boyvalenkov and Favorov proved results for measures on Euclidean space with unbounded total variation that are positive or translation bounded and have pure point Fourier transforms. They established conditions under which the measure with the same support as the Fourier transform and masses equal to the squares of the masses is translation bounded.

- **Density Discrepancy for Cut and Project Sets (2024)**: Research on sharp density discrepancy for cut and project sets using lattice point counting approaches provides uniform upper bounds on discrepancy depending on the Diophantine properties of the lattice, with universal lower bounds on the average discrepancy.

### 1.2 Polynomial Density Growth vs. Linear Density

- **Kurasov-Sarnak Construction (2020)**: The landmark paper "Stable polynomials and crystalline measures" constructed explicit examples of positive crystalline measures and Fourier quasicrystals using pairs of stable polynomials. This answered several open questions and provided the first systematic method for generating exotic crystalline measures with non-uniform support.

- **Classification of Fourier Summation Formulas (2023)**: Gonçalves provided a complete classification of Fourier summation formulas and crystalline measures with quadratic decay, employing techniques from almost periodic functions, Hermite-Biehler functions, de Branges spaces, and Poisson representation.

## 2. Key Techniques and Theoretical Frameworks

### 2.1 Guinand's Generalized Poisson Summation Formula

Research has revealed that Guinand's 1959 work contained hidden generalizations of the Poisson summation formula that were rediscovered by Meyer in 2016:

- **Connection to Modular Forms**: The summation formulas involve coefficients of modular forms, deepening connections between crystalline measures and modular form theory.
- **Crystalline Measures from Wave Equations**: Guinand's distributions arise from solutions of the wave equation on the three-dimensional torus with specific initial conditions.
- **Non-Lattice Support**: Unlike classical Poisson summation, these formulas have support on locally finite sets rather than lattices.

### 2.2 Kurasov-Sarnak Framework

The 2020 breakthrough by Kurasov and Sarnak established:
- Construction of crystalline measures via pairs of stable polynomials
- Connection to Lee-Yang polynomials and their zero sets
- Diophantine theory of tori and generalized Lang conjectures
- Resolution of several open problems about crystalline measures

### 2.3 Lev-Olevskii Contributions

Key papers by Lev and Olevskii include:
- **Fourier Quasicrystals with Unit Masses (2020)**: Proved that the sum of δ-measures on a discrete set Λ⊂ℝ forms a Fourier quasicrystal if and only if Λ is the zero set of an exponential polynomial with imaginary frequencies.
- **Classification Results**: Established that all Fourier quasicrystals with positive integer weights are divisors of real-rooted trigonometric polynomials (for n=1).

### 2.4 Favorov's Recent Developments

Favorov has been particularly active in 2020-2025:
- **Crystalline Measure Not a Fourier Quasicrystal (2024)**: Constructed the first example of a crystalline measure that is not a Fourier quasicrystal, settling a fundamental question.
- **Non-negative Crystalline and Poisson Measures (2024)**: Extended theory to more general measure classes.
- **Fourier Quasicrystals and Distributions (2023)**: Worked on bounded density spectrum problems.

## 3. Inflation and Substitution Systems with Non-Constant Factors

### 3.1 Transcendental Inflation Factors

**Substitution Tilings with Transcendental Inflation Factor (2022)**: For any λ>2, researchers constructed substitutions on infinite alphabets giving rise to substitution tilings with inflation factor λ, obtaining the first examples of substitutive systems with transcendental inflation factors.

Key properties:
- Both the associated subshift and tiling dynamical systems are strictly ergodic
- Related to quasicompactness of the underlying substitution operator
- Scaling behavior differs from traditional substitutions

### 3.2 Scaling and Growth Properties

Research has identified various scaling behaviors:
- Noble means inflations show similar scaling to Fibonacci tiling
- Period doubling sequences show different scaling
- Thue-Morse sequence exhibits exponential rather than power-law scaling
- Range of scaling exponents accessible for multi-letter substitutions

## 4. Cut-and-Project Schemes for Non-Linear Densities

- Low complexity condition from cut and project data
- Diophantine property requiring lattice points stay far from physical space
- r^d polynomial growth rates in appropriate settings

### 4.2 Diophantine Approximation Connections

Recent work has established connections between:
- Cut-and-project schemes and Diophantine approximation hypotheses
