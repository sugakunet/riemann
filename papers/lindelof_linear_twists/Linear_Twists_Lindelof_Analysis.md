# Linear Twists and the Lindelöf Hypothesis: Analysis and Bounds

## Executive Summary

Analysis of papers on exponential sums and Dirichlet polynomials reveals **limited direct treatment** of linear twists $\sum e(na)n^{-s}$ for the Lindelöf hypothesis. However, important insights emerge about the role of arithmetic properties of the twist parameter $a$.

## 1. Current State of Knowledge

### 1.1 Standard Lindelöf Hypothesis

For the Riemann zeta function:
$$\zeta(1/2 + it) = O(t^{\epsilon}) \text{ for any } \epsilon > 0$$

Current best bound (Bourgain 2014): $|\zeta(1/2 + it)| \ll t^{13/84+\epsilon} \approx t^{0.155+\epsilon}$

### 1.2 Dirichlet L-functions

The Lindelöf hypothesis extends to Dirichlet L-functions $L(s,\chi)$ for Dirichlet characters $\chi$ mod $q$:
$$L(1/2 + it, \chi) = O((q|t|)^{\epsilon})$$

## 2. Linear Twists: What We Know

### 2.1 Definition and Basic Properties

A linear twist of the zeta function:
$$Z(s,a) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{e(na)}{n^s} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{e^{2\pi i na}}{n^s}$$

where $a \in \mathbb{R}$.

### 2.2 Rational vs. Irrational Parameters

#### Rational $a = p/q$ with $(p,q) = 1$:

**Connection to Dirichlet L-functions:**
- When $a = p/q$, the sum decomposes into Dirichlet L-functions
- Can be written as: $Z(s,p/q) = \sum_{\chi \text{ mod } q} \overline{\chi}(p) L(s,\chi)$
- Therefore inherits Lindelöf bounds from Dirichlet L-functions

**Expected bound for rational $a = p/q$:**
$$|Z(1/2 + it, p/q)| = O((q|t|)^{\epsilon})$$

The dependence on $q$ is crucial - larger denominators give worse bounds.

#### Irrational $a$:

**Key findings from weighted exponential sum analysis:**

From Bag & Mazumder (2024):
- Irrational parameters generally give **better bounds** than rational ones
- This corresponds to the "minor arc" case in the circle method
- For polynomial phases with irrational leading coefficient: better cancellation

## 3. Bounds and Diophantine Properties

### 3.1 Explicit Dependence on Arithmetic Properties

For weighted exponential sums with polynomial phase $f(x)$ of degree $k$:

**Major Arc Case** (good rational approximation $|α - a/q| \leq 1/(qP)$):
$$\sum_{n \leq N} \tau(n)e(f(n)) \ll \log N \cdot N^{1+\epsilon}\left(\frac{1}{q} + \frac{q}{N^k} + \frac{1}{N^{1-\theta}}\right)^{\gamma}$$

**Minor Arc Case** (poor rational approximation/irrational):
$$\sum_{n \leq N} \tau(n)e(f(n)) \ll \log N \cdot N^{1+\epsilon-\gamma/2}$$

### 3.2 Implications for Linear Twists

By analogy, for linear twists $\sum e(na)n^{-s}$:

**Rational $a = p/q$:**
- Bound should depend on $q$
- Larger $q$ → worse bounds
- Consistent with Dirichlet L-function decomposition

**Irrational $a$:**
- Should give better bounds than rational with large denominator
- Diophantine properties of $a$ crucial:
  - Badly approximable numbers (e.g., quadratic irrationals) → best bounds
  - Liouville numbers → potentially worse bounds

## 4. Conjectures and Open Questions

### 4.1 Extended Lindelöf Hypothesis for Linear Twists

**Conjecture (Rational case):** For $a = p/q$ with $(p,q) = 1$:
$$\left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{e(na)}{n^{1/2+it}}\right| = O((q|t|)^{\epsilon})$$

**Conjecture (Irrational case):** For irrational $a$:
$$\left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{e(na)}{n^{1/2+it}}\right| = O(|t|^{\epsilon})$$

with possible refinements based on Diophantine type of $a$.

### 4.2 Diophantine Refinement

For irrational $a$ with irrationality measure $\mu(a)$:
- $\mu(a) = 2$ for almost all reals and algebraic irrationals of degree ≥ 2
- $\mu(a) > 2$ for Liouville numbers

**Refined Conjecture:** The bound might depend on $\mu(a)$:
$$\left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{e(na)}{n^{1/2+it}}\right| = O(|t|^{f(\mu(a))+\epsilon})$$

where $f$ is increasing.

## 5. Evidence and Heuristics

### 5.1 Supporting Evidence

1. **Circle Method:** Minor arcs (irrational case) give better bounds
2. **Decoupling Theory:** Less arithmetic structure → better decoupling
3. **Weyl Sums:** Similar phenomenon for polynomial exponential sums

### 5.2 Challenges

1. **No direct treatment** in current literature
2. **Technical difficulties** extending Dirichlet L-function methods to irrational $a$
3. **Lack of functional equation** for general irrational twists

## 6. Research Gaps and Future Directions

### 6.1 Immediate Questions

1. **Explicit bounds** for specific irrational $a$ (e.g., $a = \sqrt{2}$, $a = e$, $a = \pi$)
2. **Numerical experiments** to test conjectured bounds
3. **Connection to decoupling theory** for linear phases

### 6.2 Theoretical Developments Needed

1. **Functional equations** or approximate functional equations for irrational twists
2. **Zero-free regions** for twisted zeta functions
3. **Mean value theorems** for twisted sums

### 6.3 Potential Approaches

1. **Extend Bourgain's decoupling** to pure linear phases
2. **Adapt Fokas's integral equation method** to twisted sums
3. **Develop circle method** specifically for linear twists

## 7. Conclusion

While the Lindelöf hypothesis for linear twists with irrational parameters remains **largely unexplored**, the available evidence suggests:

1. **Rational twists:** Inherit bounds from Dirichlet L-functions with explicit $q$-dependence
2. **Irrational twists:** Should satisfy Lindelöf with better bounds than rational approximations
3. **Diophantine properties:** Crucial for determining precise bounds

The problem represents a natural but challenging extension of the classical Lindelöf hypothesis, requiring new techniques beyond current methods for L-functions.
