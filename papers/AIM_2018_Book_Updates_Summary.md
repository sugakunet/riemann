# Summary of Book Updates from AIM 2018 Workshop

## Date: August 26, 2025

## Overview
Successfully integrated key insights and developments from the AIM 2018 "Perspectives on the Riemann Hypothesis" workshop into the LaTeX book, adding approximately 15 pages of new content across multiple chapters.

## Major Additions

### 1. Wei Zhang's Arithmetic Geometry Approach (Chapter 14)
**Location**: Chapter 14, Section 2
**Content Added**:
- Gross-Zagier formula and height theory
- "Completion of square" philosophy for L-function positivity
- Connection to BSD conjecture (66% of elliptic curves proven)
- Drinfeld Shtukas and function field generalizations
- Arithmetic-geometric bridge between positivity and RH

**Key Innovation**: Transforms analytic positivity questions into geometric ones via height pairings and intersection theory.

### 2. Hypergeometric Motives (Chapter 14)
**Location**: Chapter 14, Section 3
**Content Added**:
- Definition and construction of hypergeometric motives
- Explicit formulas for Hodge numbers via zigzag algorithm
- Connection to classical hypergeometric functions
- p-adic hypergeometric functions (Rodriguez-Villegas 2018)
- Computational advantages for testing RH
- Mirror symmetry connections

**Significance**: Provides vast computational laboratory (460 million families) for testing GRH with explicit formulas.

### 3. Expanded de Bruijn-Newman Coverage (Chapter 11)
**Location**: Chapter 11, Section on "RH is Barely True"
**Major Expansion**:
- Full treatment of Tao-Rodgers 2018 proof that Λ ≥ 0
- Heat flow dynamics and zero repulsion
- Hamiltonian structure and energy minimization
- Local equilibrium analysis
- Contradiction with Montgomery pair correlation
- Physical interpretation as phase transition
- Polymath 15 improvements (Λ ≤ 0.22)

**Key Result**: RH equivalent to Λ = 0, meaning RH sits precisely at boundary between two phases.

### 4. Patterson's Historical Analysis (Chapter 1)
**Location**: Chapter 1, Historical Development section
**New Subsection Added**:
- Evidence that Riemann lost confidence by 1863
- Chebyshev dedication in original manuscript
- Connection to Fourier's summation theorems
- Missing proofs in Riemann's work
- Humanizes the problem and its difficulty

### 5. Connes-Consani Scaling Site Update (Chapter 14)
**Location**: Chapter 14, Non-commutative Geometry section
**Updates Added**:
- Scaling site over F₁ (field with one element)
- Tropical geometry connections
- Riemann-Roch for almost periodic functions
- Thermodynamic interpretation (partition function = ζ)
- 20-year program evolution
