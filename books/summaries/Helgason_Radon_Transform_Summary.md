# Summary: The Radon Transform by Sigurdur Helgason

## Overview
This seminal work by Helgason provides a comprehensive treatment of the Radon transform and its generalizations, bridging classical integral geometry with modern harmonic analysis and representation theory. The book demonstrates how the Radon transform serves as a fundamental tool in analysis, geometry, and applications ranging from medical imaging to partial differential equations.

## Part I: Classical Radon Transform

### Fundamental Definitions

#### The Radon Transform
For a function $f$ integrable on each hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$, the **Radon transform** is:
$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{\xi} f(x) dm(x)$$
where:
- $\xi$ is a hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$
- $dm$ is the Euclidean measure on hyperplane $\xi$
- $P^n$ denotes the space of all hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$

#### Dual Transform
The **dual transform** $\phi \to \check{\phi}$ associates to a continuous function $\phi$ on $P^n$:
$$\check{\phi}(x) = \int_{x \in \xi} \phi(\xi) d\mu(\xi)$$
where $d\mu$ is the rotation-invariant measure on hyperplanes through $x$.

#### Parametrization
Each hyperplane $\xi \in P^n$ can be written as:
$$\xi = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \langle x, \omega \rangle = p\}$$
where $\omega \in S^{n-1}$ is a unit vector and $p \in \mathbb{R}$ is the signed distance to origin.

### Fundamental Theorems

#### Schwartz Theorem (Theorem 2.4)
The Radon transform $f \to \hat{f}$ is a **linear one-to-one mapping** of $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ onto $\mathcal{S}_H(P^n)$, where:
- $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ = rapidly decreasing functions
- $\mathcal{S}_H(P^n)$ = functions satisfying homogeneity conditions

#### Support Theorem (Theorem 2.6)
Let $f \in C(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfy:
1. $|x|^k f(x)$ is bounded for each integer $k > 0$
2. $\hat{f}(\xi) = 0$ for $d(0,\xi) > A$ (some constant $A > 0$)

Then: **$f(x) = 0$ for $|x| > A$**

#### Inversion Formula (Theorem 3.1)
The function $f$ can be recovered from its Radon transform:
$$cf = (-L)^{(n-1)/2}((\hat{f})^{\vee})$$
where:
- $c = (4\pi)^{(n-1)/2}\Gamma(n/2)/\Gamma(1/2)$
- $L$ is the Laplacian on $\mathbb{R}^n$
- $(\hat{f})^{\vee}$ is the dual transform of $\hat{f}$

### Connection to Fourier Transform

**Fundamental Relationship**:
$$\tilde{f}(s\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\omega,r) e^{-isr} dr$$

This shows that the **$n$-dimensional Fourier transform equals the 1-dimensional Fourier transform of the Radon transform**.

## Part II: Geometric Framework

### Homogeneous Spaces in Duality

The geometric foundation rests on **homogeneous spaces in duality**:
- Points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are both homogeneous spaces of the motion group $M(n)$
- This motivates the general definition for homogeneous spaces $G/K$ and $G/H$

### Mean Value Operators

For sphere $S_r(x) = \{y : |y-x| = r\}$, the mean value operator:
$$M_r f(x) = \frac{1}{A(r)} \int_{S_r(x)} f(\omega) d\omega$$

satisfies the crucial property: **$LM_r = M_r L$** (commutativity with Laplacian).

### Geometric Interpretation

The dual transform can be expressed as:
$$(\hat{f})^{\vee}(x) = \frac{\Omega_{n-1}}{\Omega_n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |x-y|^{-1} f(y) dy$$

This connects the Radon transform to **convolution with the fundamental solution** $|x|^{-1}$ of the Laplacian.

## Part III: Generalizations

### X-ray Transform

The X-ray transform integrates functions over lines instead of hyperplanes:
$$Xf(L) = \int_L f(x) dl$$

**Key difference**: While the Radon transform has good inversion properties in odd dimensions, the X-ray transform behaves well in all dimensions.

### Spherical Radon Transform

Integrates functions over spheres rather than hyperplanes:
$$R_s f(S) = \int_S f(x) d\sigma(x)$$

Applications in:
- Thermoacoustic tomography
- Sonar imaging
- Seismic imaging

### Radon Transform on Symmetric Spaces

For symmetric space $G/K$:
- Generalizes to integration over totally geodesic submanifolds
- Preserves key duality principles
- Applications to harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces

## Part IV: Applications

### Medical Imaging

#### Computed Tomography (CT)
- Based on inverting the 2D Radon transform
- Reconstruction from X-ray projections
- Filtered backprojection algorithm

#### Mathematical Foundation
The reconstruction formula in 2D:
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\theta,s) h(x \cdot \theta - s) ds d\theta$$
where $h$ is the Hilbert transform kernel.

### Partial Differential Equations

#### Wave Equation
The Radon transform converts the wave equation:
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = \Delta u$$
into a family of 1D wave equations.

#### Applications
- Huygens' principle
- Propagation of singularities
- Microlocal analysis

### Integral Geometry

#### Fundamental Questions
- How to determine a function from integrals over geometric objects?
- What conditions ensure unique reconstruction?
- Stability and continuity of inversion

#### Crofton's Formula
In 2D, the measure of a curve equals:
$$\text{Length}(\gamma) = \frac{1}{2} \int \#(\gamma \cap L) dL$$
where integration is over all lines $L$.

## Part V: Advanced Theory

### Range Characterization

#### Moment Conditions
A function $\phi$ on $P^n$ is in the range of the Radon transform if and only if:
1. $\phi$ satisfies appropriate decay conditions
2. $\phi$ satisfies the moment conditions:
   $$\int_{S^{n-1}} p^k \phi(\omega,p) dp = P_k(\omega)$$
   where $P_k$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $k$

### Microlocal Analysis

#### Wavefront Set
The Radon transform preserves and reveals the **wavefront set** (singular support in phase space):
- Singularities of $f$ correspond to singularities of $\hat{f}$
- Provides detailed information about propagation of singularities

### Group-Theoretic Framework

#### Representation Theory
The Radon transform intertwines group representations:
- Acts as an intertwining operator between representations on function spaces
- Fourier analysis on groups provides unified framework
- Connects to Plancherel theorem and harmonic analysis

- Integration over points in a geometric object
