## Edwards' Overall Assessment of RH (as of 1974)

### The Central Mystery
Edwards presents the Riemann Hypothesis as the paramount unsolved problem in mathematics, with his book serving as both a comprehensive exposition of what was known and a testament to what remained mysterious. By 1974, over a century after Riemann's paper, the hypothesis remained as enigmatic as ever.

### State of Evidence in 1974

#### Computational Verification
- **Backlund (1914)**: Verified RH for T = 200, finding N(200) = 29 zeros
- **Gram (1903)**: Established computational methods, discovered "Gram's law"
- **Haselgrove and others**: Extended verification to higher values
- **Lehmer**: Pushed computational boundaries significantly
- **By 1974**: RH verified for first several billion zeros

#### Theoretical Progress
Edwards catalogues the major theoretical advances:

1. **Hardy (1914)**: Proved infinitely many zeros lie on Re s = 1/2
2. **Hardy-Littlewood**: Showed at least a positive proportion of zeros are on the critical line
3. **Selberg**: Proved that a positive proportion of zeros lie on Re s = 1/2
4. **Levinson and others**: Continued refinements of the proportion

### Edwards' Perspective on Proof Strategies

#### The Fundamental Challenge
Edwards implicitly recognizes several fundamental obstacles that had emerged by 1974:

1. **Analytic Complexity**: The zeta function's intricate behavior defies simple analysis
2. **Transcendental Nature**: The problem bridges number theory and complex analysis in ways that resist elementary approaches
3. **Non-constructive Methods**: Most progress came through indirect methods rather than constructive proofs

#### Promising but Incomplete Approaches

**1. Hardy-Littlewood Methods**
- Edwards details their approximate functional equation approach
- Shows how they achieved partial results on zero distribution
- Highlights the fundamental limitation: proving "most" vs "all" zeros

**2. Computational Methods**
- Edwards sees computational verification as providing strong evidence
- Notes the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms
- Recognizes limitations of pure computation for proving an infinite statement

**3. Connection to Prime Distribution**
- Edwards emphasizes the deep connection between RH and prime number distribution
- Shows how RH would resolve fundamental questions about π(x) - Li(x)
- Demonstrates that RH represents the "best possible" error estimates

### Historical and Mathematical Philosophy

#### Riemann's Vision
Edwards presents Riemann as having remarkable intuition about the zeros' location despite limited computational tools. The fact that all computed zeros lay on the critical line suggested Riemann had deep insight into the function's structure.

#### The Role of Computation
By 1974, Edwards saw computation as playing a crucial supportive role:
- **Evidence Gathering**: Computational verification provided overwhelming empirical support
- **Method Development**: Computational techniques (like the Riemann-Siegel formula) advanced theoretical understanding
- **Pattern Recognition**: Numerical studies revealed phenomena like Gram's law and its exceptions

#### Mathematical Significance
Edwards positions RH as far more than an isolated conjecture:
- **Central to Number Theory**: Connects to fundamental questions about prime distribution
- **Bridge Between Areas**: Links analytic number theory, complex analysis, and emerging areas
- **Methodological Impact**: Techniques developed for RH advanced multiple mathematical fields

### Edwards' Assessment of Difficulty

#### Why RH Remained Unsolved
Edwards' treatment suggests several reasons for RH's persistence:

1. **Technical Sophistication Required**: The problem demands mastery of multiple mathematical areas
2. **Subtle Cancellations**: The zeta function exhibits delicate balances that resist direct analysis
3. **Global vs Local Behavior**: Understanding individual zeros vs their collective distribution
4. **Fundamental Novelty**: The problem may require entirely new mathematical concepts

#### The Standard of Proof
Edwards emphasizes the rigorous standards required:
- Computational evidence, while overwhelming, cannot constitute proof
- Heuristic arguments, while compelling, fall short of mathematical certainty
- The proof would need to handle the infinite nature of the statement

### Connections to Broader Mathematics

#### Prime Number Theory
Edwards shows how RH sits at the heart of prime number theory:
- **Error Estimates**: RH gives optimal bounds for π(x) - Li(x)
- **L-functions**: Similar questions arise for Dirichlet L-functions
- **Arithmetic Functions**: RH impacts understanding of many arithmetic functions

#### Complex Analysis
The problem showcases deep connections to:
- **Entire Function Theory**: Product formulas and growth estimates
- **Analytic Continuation**: Extension of functions beyond their natural domains
- **Asymptotic Analysis**: Behavior of functions for large arguments

### Edwards' Implicit Predictions (1974)

Based on his comprehensive treatment, Edwards seemed to believe:

1. **Computational Evidence**: The numerical evidence would continue to support RH
2. **Theoretical Tools**: New mathematical techniques would be needed
3. **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Progress would require combining multiple mathematical areas
4. **Historical Significance**: A proof would represent a watershed moment in mathematics

### The Legacy of Edwards' Assessment

#### Methodological Contributions
Edwards' book established several important principles:
- **Comprehensive Approach**: Successful RH research requires understanding multiple perspectives
- **Historical Awareness**: Knowledge of previous attempts prevents repetition of errors
- **Computational Integration**: Numerical and theoretical approaches must work together

#### Educational Impact
Edwards created the definitive reference work that:
- Made Riemann's original work accessible
- Catalogued all major progress through 1974
- Established the standard for rigorous exposition of RH

### Conclusion: Edwards' 1974 Perspective

Edwards concludes his monumental work with a sense of both achievement and humility. The mathematical community had made substantial progress in understanding the zeta function and its zeros, yet the central question remained unanswered.

His final assessment suggests RH represented the deepest kind of mathematical problem—one where:
- **Evidence overwhelmingly supports the conjecture**
- **Multiple sophisticated approaches yield partial results**
- **The complete solution may require fundamentally new insights**
- **Success would transform our understanding of numbers and functions**

Edwards' work stands as both a comprehensive survey of progress through 1974 and an implicit challenge to future mathematicians. His meticulous documentation of methods, results, and remaining obstacles provided the foundation for all subsequent RH research.

The enduring value of Edwards' assessment lies not just in what was known by 1974, but in his clear articulation of what remained mysterious—a mystery that persists to this day, making his work as relevant now as when it was written.
