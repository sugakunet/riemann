# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is currently a minimal repository containing research materials related to Riemann mathematics. The repository structure is:

- `papers/` - Contains research papers (currently Oral_Paper.pdf)
- `books/` - Directory for books (currently empty)

## Current State

The repository does not yet contain any code implementation. It appears to be in the initial stages of setup for a mathematics or research-related project.

## Future Development

When code is added to this repository, this file should be updated with:
- Build and test commands
- Code architecture and structure
- Development guidelines specific to the project
