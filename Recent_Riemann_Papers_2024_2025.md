# Riemann Hypothesis Specific

## Detecting zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions via the Riemann zeta-function

**Authors:** Masatoshi Suzuki

**ArXiv ID:** [2508.17701v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17701)

**Date:** 2025-08-25

**Categories:** math.NT, 11M26

**Abstract:** Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we show that a certain vertical distribution of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function is equivalent to the generalized Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions. Furthermore, under both the Riemann hypothesis and the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we show that the nontrivial zeros of Dirichlet $L$-functions can be detected through those of the Riemann zeta-function.

## Formalizing zeta and L-functions in Lean

**Authors:** David Loeffler, Michael Stoll

**ArXiv ID:** [2503.00959v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00959)

**Date:** 2025-03-02

**Abstract:** The Riemann zeta function, and more generally the L-functions of Dirichlet characters, are among the central objects of study in number theory. We report on a project to formalize the theory of these objects in Lean's "Mathlib" library, including a proof of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions and a formal statement of the Riemann hypothesis

## Riesz type criteria for $L$-functions in the Selberg class

**Authors:** Shivajee Gupta, Akshaa Vatwani

**ArXiv ID:** [2211.02954v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02954)

**Date:** 2022-11-05

**Categories:** math.NT, Primary 11M06, Secondary 11M26, 11M41, 33C20

**Abstract:** We formulate a generalization of Riesz-type criteria in the setting of $L$-functions belonging to the Selberg class. We obtain a criterion which is sufficient for the Grand Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for $L$-functions satisfying axioms of the Selberg class without imposing the Ramanujan hypothesis on their coefficients. We also construct a subclass of the Selberg class and prove a necessary criterion for GRH for $L$-functions in this subclass. Identities of Ramanujan-Hardy-Littlewood type are also established in this setting, specific cases of which yield new transformation formulas involving special values of the Meijer $G$-function of the type $G^{n \ 0}_{0 \ n}$.

## Noncommutative Riemann hypothesis

**Authors:** Goncalo Tabuada

**ArXiv ID:** [2105.09935v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09935)

**Date:** 2021-05-20

**Categories:** math.AG, math.AT, math.KT, math.RT

**Abstract:** In this note, making use of noncommutative $l$-adic cohomology, we extend the generalized Riemann hypothesis from the realm of algebraic geometry to the broad setting of geometric noncommutative schemes in the sense of Orlov. As a first application, we prove that the generalized Riemann hypothesis is invariant under derived equivalences and homological projective duality. As a second application, we prove the noncommutative generalized Riemann hypothesis in some new cases.

## Moments of the Riemann zeta function at its local extrema

**Authors:** Andrew Pearce-Crump

**ArXiv ID:** [2411.05568v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05568)

**Date:** 2024-11-08

**Categories:** math.NT, 11M06

**Abstract:** Conrey, Ghosh and Gonek studied the first moment of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function evaluated at the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function, resolving a problem known as Shanks' conjecture. Conrey and Ghosh studied the second moment of the Riemann zeta function evaluated at its local extrema along the critical line to leading order.   In this paper we combine the two results, evaluating the first moment of the zeta function and its derivatives at the local extrema of zeta along the critical line, giving a full asymptotic. We also consider the factor from the functional equation for the zeta function at these extrema.

## On convergence of points to limiting processes, with an application to   zeta zeros

**Authors:** Juan Arias de Reyna, Brad Rodgers

**ArXiv ID:** [2311.13441v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13441)

**Date:** 2023-11-22

**Categories:** math.NT, math.PR

**Abstract:** This paper considers sequences of points on the real line which have been randomly translated, and provides conditions under which various notions of convergence to a limiting point process are equivalent. In particular we consider convergence in correlation, convergence in distribution, and convergence of spacings between points. We also prove a simple Tauberian theorem regarding rescaled correlations. The results are applied to zeros of the Riemann zeta-function to show that several ways to state the GUE Hypothesis are equivalent. The proof relies on a moment bound of A. Fujii.

## Discrete universality for Matsumoto zeta-functions and the nontrivial   zeros of the Riemann zeta-function

**Authors:** Keita Nakai

**ArXiv ID:** [2308.16396v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16396)

**Date:** 2023-08-31

**Categories:** math.NT, 11M41

**Abstract:** In 2017, Garunk\v{s}tis, Laurin\v{c}ikas and Macaitien\.{e} proved the discrete universality theorem for the Riemann zeta-function sifted by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. This discrete universality has been extended in various zeta-functions and $L$-functions. In this paper, we generalize this discrete universality for Matsumoto zeta-functions.

**Categories:** math.NT

**Abstract:** We discuss moments of the Riemann zeta-function in this paper. The purpose of this paper is to give an upper bound of exponential moments of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta-function twisted by arguments. Our results contain an improvement of Najnudel result for exponential moments of the argument of the Riemann zeta-function and an unconditional upper bound of the moments.

## Moments of the Hurwitz zeta function on the critical line

**Authors:** Anurag Sahay

**ArXiv ID:** [2103.13542v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13542)

**Date:** 2021-03-25

**Categories:** math.NT, 11M35 (Primary), 11M06 (Secondary)

**Abstract:** We study the moments $M_k(T;\alpha) = \int_T^{2T} |\zeta(s,\alpha)|^{2k}\,dt$ of the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,\alpha)$ on the critical line, $s = 1/2 + it$ with a rational shift $\alpha \in \mathbb Q$. We conjecture, in analogy with the Riemann zeta function, that $M_k(T;\alpha) \sim c_k(\alpha) T (\log T)^{k^2}$ . Using heuristics from analytic number theory and random matrix theory, we conjecturally compute $c_k(\alpha)$. In the process, we investigate moments of products of Dirichlet $L$-functions on the critical line. We prove our conjectures for the cases $k = 1,2$.

## Weighted value distributions of the Riemann zeta function on the   critical line

**Authors:** Alessandro Fazzari

**ArXiv ID:** [2101.08036v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08036)

**Date:** 2021-01-20

**Categories:** math.NT

**Abstract:** We prove a central limit theorem for $\log|\zeta(1/2+it)|$ with respect to the measure $|\zeta^{(m)}(1/2+it)|^{2k}dt$ ($k,m\in\mathbb N$), assuming RH and the asymptotic formula for twisted and shifted integral moments of zeta. Under the same hypotheses, we also study a shifted case, looking at the measure $|\zeta(1/2+it+i\alpha)|^{2k}dt$, with $\alpha\in(-1,1)$. Finally we prove unconditionally the analogue result in the random matrix theory context.

## Value-Distribution of the Riemann Zeta-Function along its Julia Lines

**Authors:** Jörn Steuding, Ade Irma Suriajaya

**ArXiv ID:** [2007.14661v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14661)

**Date:** 2020-07-29

**Categories:** math.NT, math.CV, 11M06, 30D35

**Abstract:** For an arbitrary complex number $a\neq 0$ we consider the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta$ at the $a$-points of the function $\Delta$ which appears in the functional equation $\zeta(s)=\Delta(s)\zeta(1-s)$. These $a$-points $\delta_a$ are clustered around the critical line $1/2+i\mathbb{R}$ which happens to be a Julia line for the essential singularity of $\zeta$ at infinity. We observe a remarkable average behaviour for the sequence of values $\zeta(\delta_a)$.

## On the moments of the moments of $ζ(1/2+it)$

**Authors:** E. C. Bailey, J. P. Keating

**ArXiv ID:** [2006.04503v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04503)

**Date:** 2020-06-08

**Categories:** math.NT, math-ph, math.MP

**Abstract:** Taking $t$ at random, uniformly from $[0,T]$, we consider the $k$th moment, with respect to $t$, of the random variable corresponding to the $2\beta$th moment of $\zeta(1/2+ix)$ over the interval $x\in(t, t+1]$, where $\zeta(s)$ is the Riemann zeta function. We call these the `moments of moments' of the Riemann zeta function, and present a conjecture for their asymptotics, when $T\to\infty$, for integer $k,\beta$. This is motivated by comparisons with results for the moments of moments of the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices and is shown to follow from a conjecture for the shifted moments of $\zeta(s)$ due to Conrey, Farmer, Keating, Rubinstein, and Snaith \cite{cfkrs2}. Specifically, we prove that a function which, the shifted-moment conjecture of \cite{cfkrs2} implies, is a close approximation to the moments of moments of the zeta function does satisfy the asymptotic formula that we conjecture. We motivate as well similar conjectures for the moments of moments for other families of primitive $L$-functions.

Combining this estimate with the recent result of Balog-Biro-Cherubini-Laaksonen, we improve the error term in the prime geodesic theorem for the Picard manifold.

## Game-Theoretic Unlearnable Example Generator

**Authors:** Shuang Liu, Yihan Wang, Xiao-Shan Gao

**ArXiv ID:** [2401.17523v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17523)

**Date:** 2024-01-31

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CR, stat.ML

**Abstract:** Unlearnable example attacks are data poisoning attacks aiming to degrade the clean test accuracy of deep learning by adding imperceptible perturbations to the training samples, which can be formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. However, directly solving this optimization problem is intractable for deep neural networks. In this paper, we investigate unlearnable example attacks from a game-theoretic perspective, by formulating the attack as a nonzero sum Stackelberg game. First, the existence of game equilibria is proved under the normal setting and the adversarial training setting. It is shown that the game equilibrium gives the most powerful poison attack in that the victim has the lowest test accuracy among all networks within the same hypothesis space, when certain loss functions are used. Second, we propose a novel attack method, called the Game Unlearnable Example (GUE), which has three main gradients. (1) The poisons are obtained by directly solving the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game with a first-order algorithm. (2) We employ an autoencoder-like generative network model as the poison attacker. (3) A novel payoff function is introduced to evaluate the performance of the poison. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GUE can effectively poison the model in various scenarios. Furthermore, the GUE still...

## On the relation between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions

**Authors:** Norio Konno

**ArXiv ID:** [2306.14625v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14625)

**Date:** 2023-06-26

**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph, math.CO, math.MP, math.NT, math.PR

**Abstract:** The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, the absolute zeta function can be considered as a zeta function over F_1. This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute zeta function. First we deal with a zeta function determined by a time evolution matrix of the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of the quantum walk. Then we prove that the zeta function given by the quantum walk is an absolute automorphic form of weight depending on the number of edges of the graph. Furthermore we consider an absolute zeta function for the zeta function based on a quantum walk. As an example, we compute an absolute zeta function for the cycle graph and show that it is expressed as the multiple gamma function of order 2.

## On algebra of big zeta values

**Authors:** Nikita Markarian

**ArXiv ID:** [2011.04944v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04944)

**Date:** 2020-11-10

**Categories:** math.NT, math.AG

**Abstract:** The algebra of big zeta values we introduce in this paper is an intermediate object between multiple zeta values and periods of the multiple zeta motive. It consists of number series generalizing multiple zeta values, the simplest examples, which are not multiple zeta series, are Tornheim sums. We show that convergent big zeta values are periods of the moduli space of stable curves of genus zero on one hand and multiple zeta values on the other hand. It gives an alternative way to prove that any such period may be expressed as a rational linear combination of multiple zeta values and a simple algorithm for finding such an expression.
